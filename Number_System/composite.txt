    A composite number is a positive integer greater

    than 1 that can be evenly divided by at least one
    
    positive integer other than 1 and itself.
    
    In other words, a composite number has divisors
    
    other than 1 and itself.
    
    These divisors are also called proper divisors.

    For example, let's take the number 12.
    
    It is a composite number because it can be evenly
    
    divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
    
    All these numbers (except 1 and 12) are divisors
    
    of 12, making it a composite number.
